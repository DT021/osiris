    - 'Tsuki ga Kirei', pretty simple and touching.
    - 'Gosick', this isn't always lovey-dovey but it is worth it.
    - 'Hal', even the synopsis fooled you.
    - 'Plastic Memories', this is a good anime where you know you'll cry.
    - 'Kimi no na wa', what is your name again? Just kidding.
    - 'Weathering with You', that day we changed the shape of the world. Nice cameo by the way.
    - 'I Want to Eat Your Pancreas', this is some kind of sad romance right here. Nothing about zombies.
    - 'Sakurasou no Pet Kanojo', pretty nice about relationships where you have inferiority complex.
    - 'Gamers!', worth it to watch romantic comedy with the hilarious misunderstandings.
    - 'Kaguya-sama: Love is War', that ending was Chikamazing.
    - 'Anohana', ghost movie love story meets kids and anime.
    - 'Erased', not exactly romance but still beautiful.
    - 'Hyouka', not romance but rather is slice of life and is totally good.
